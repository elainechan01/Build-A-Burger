## Task:

Build a game using the concept of objects and classes. The main algorithm to implement to modify the burger is to use the concept of stacks and its theory of LIFO (stack implementation: https://realpython.com/how-to-implement-python-stack/). In other words, when adding ingredients to the burger, the ingredients will be added to the end of the list; when looking to remove an element from the burger, the last element of the list is considered. The main implementation of the game can be found under the main function.

## Exceptions and Constraints:

- Implementation of objects and classes are required
- Existing code is not allowed to be modified, you are only to modify the `add_ingredient()`, `pop_ingredient()` and `serve_burger()` functions
- All `add_ingredient()`, `pop_ingredient()` and `serve_burger()` functions must work with the `burger` self property 

## Expected Output
